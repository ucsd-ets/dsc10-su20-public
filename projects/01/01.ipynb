    "In this project we'll explore some data about California. The project is a little longer than a homework, but the questions may require you to **\"put the pieces together\"** more than a typical homework question. You may have to perform several steps to answer a question. Remember that you can always save intermediate results!\n",
    "\n",
    "The datasets in this project consist of real-world data, cleaned slighty for ease of use. As such, there are occasional anomalies that you'll have to look out for and handle specially. You are encouraged to ask your own questions and try to answer them using these datasets!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logistics\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deadline.** This project is due at **11:59pm on Thursday July 30**. It's much better to be early than late, so start working now.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Plotting Questions**: The plots for the project are **optional** and ungraded, meaning you do **not** need to submit a PDF of this notebook to Gradescope. Hoewever, the plotting questions are good practice for the midterm.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Partners.** You may work with one other partner; only one of you is required to submit the project. On gradescope, the person who submits should also designate their partner so that both of you receive credit.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rules.** Don't share your code with anybody but your partner. You are welcome to discuss questions with other students, but don't share the answers or code. The experience of solving the problems in this project will prepare you for exams (and life). If someone asks you for the answer, resist! Instead, you can demonstrate how you would solve a similar problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Support.** You are not alone! Come to office hours, post on Campuswire, and talk to your classmates. If you want to ask about the details of your solution to a problem, make a private Campuswire post and the staff will respond. If you're ever feeling overwhelmed or don't know how to make progress, send a private Campuswire post to instructors for help.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tests.** The tests that are given are not comprehensive and passing the tests for a question does not mean that you answered the question correctly. Tests usually only check that your table has the correct column labels. However, more tests will be applied to verify the correctness of your submission in order to assign your final score, so be careful and check your work!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advice.** Develop your answers incrementally. To perform a complicated table manipulation, break it up into steps, perform each step on a different line, give a new name to each result, and check that each intermediate result is what you expect. You can add any additional names or functions you want to the provided cells. Make sure that you are using distinct and meaningful variable names throughout the notebook. Along that line, DO NOT reuse the variable names that we use when we grade your answers, otherwise there is the chance that our tests will grade against a variable that's not what you intened (especially if you run the notebook out of order!).\n",
    "\n",
    "You never have to use just one line in this project or any other assignments. Use intermediate variables and multiple lines as much as you would like!"
